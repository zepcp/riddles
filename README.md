# Riddles

## Fake coin
You have 12 coins where one of them is fake (either lighter or heavier weight).

You get have measurements on a balanced scale to find out the fake coin.

## Two eggs One Building
You are in a 100 floors building and have two eggs with you.

What's the best strategy to minimize the number of trials to discover the first floor from where they break ?

Please assume that if they didn't break from the floor x they are in the same condition as they were before. 

If they break you can't use them again.
